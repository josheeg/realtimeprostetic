realtimeprostetic
Code Repository for realtime capacitive active electrodes arduino and computer laptop software.

The sequence is arduino reads adc transmits by 8 bit serial virtual usb com port
python reads the long 24 bit int in from the adc and it is a pandas time series
python moving window transform example runs
time domain statistics runs on moving window transform
herarchal clustering of time domain statistics unsupervised machine learning
classifier compares clusters to new statistics outputs python automation for guis mouse and keyboard outputs.
